# TowerDefenceGodot
This is a repo for my game engine project of module Fundamentals of Game Development (FOGD) part 2.
<br>[Part 1 of this module!](https://github.com/bas-boop/FundamentalsOfGameDevelopment)<br><br>

I'm remaking/rebuilding an [older tower defence](https://github.com/bas-boop/VormenVsFormen) project but in Godot 4.3 mono as a module project. It's not the default assigment because I already have experience in Unity. To learn more and challenge myself I have chosen this project.
